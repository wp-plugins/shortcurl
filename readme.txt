Use the shortcodes remote_get and preg_replace to fetch external content and parse it to use on your page or post.

== Description ==

Use the shortcode "remote_get" with the parameter "url" to insert the content from that url into your page or post. You can also use parameters like start and stop (or end) to parse out a specific part of the content that you wish to display.

Now you can also wrap any content in the "preg_replace" shortcode to manipulate it into the desired format. Tricky stuff, but very powerful, if you know what you're doing.
